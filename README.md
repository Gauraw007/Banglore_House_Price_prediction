# Banglore_House_Price_prediction

## Context
This project was made because I was intrigued and  I wanted  to  gain  hands-on  experience  with  the  Machine Learning Project

## METHODOLOGY 
### Data Collection
The statistics were gathered from  Bangalore  home  prices. The  information  includes  many  variables  such  as  area type, availability,  location, BHK, society,  total square feet, bathrooms, and balconies.
### Linear Regression 
Linear regression is  a supervised  learning  technique. It  is responsible  for  predicting  the  value  of  a  dependent variable (Y) based on a  given  independent variable (X).  It is the connection between the input (X) and the output (Y). It  is  one  of  the  most  well-known  and  well-understood machine  learning  algorithms.  Simple  linear  regression, ordinary  least  squares,  Gradient  Descent,  and Regularization are the linear regression models.

## PROJECT
### Problem Statement
Create  a  model  to  estimate  the  price  of  houses  in Bengaluru and host it on Heroku.
### Data 
The  data  is  the  most  important  aspect  of  a  machine learning assignment, to which  special attention should  be paid.  Indeed,  the  data  will  heavily  affect  the  findings depending  on  where  we  found  them,  how  they  are presented, if  they are consistent, if there is  an outlier, and so on. Many  questions must  be addressed  at this  stage  to ensure that the learning algorithm is efficient and correct. To obtain, clean, and convert the data, many sub steps are required.  We  will  go  through  these  steps  to  understand how  they've  been  used  in  my  project  and  why  they're helpful for the machine learning section.
